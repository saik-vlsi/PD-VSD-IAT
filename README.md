## **Introduction** 
### Objective
The objective of this workshop is to explore Physical Design Flow concepts and implement RTL2GDSII using open source EDA tools with minimum or zero intervention. 

### Methodology
This workshop uses *Intelligent Assessment Technology* to bridge the gaps in the concepts required to implement the physical design flow.
> VSD-IAT is a cloud platform which has video sessions, assessments and Lab Session that are required to complete the training tasks and meet the design requirements. 
### Prerequisite
1. System/Laptop with Web Browser that supports VSD-IAT
2. Good Internet Connection
3. Basic Linux usage knowledge like terminal commands, vi/gvim, less, etc.,
4. Zeal to learn

### Tools Used
> 1. Yosys and abc are the open source EDA tools used for RTL synthesis
> 2. OpenSTA for Static Timing Analysis
> 3. Fault for Design for Test (DFT) *yet to be configured*
> 4. OpenROAD for Floorplanning, Placement, CTS, Optimization and Global Routing
> 5. Yosys for Logic Equivalence Check (LEC)
> 6. TritonROute for Detailed Routing
> 7. magic for GDSII streaming, DRC and SPICE extraction form layout
> 8. magic and netgen for LVS
